Area Zhuoyue Hao Shihang Wang Yeqi Zhang 2021-04-10 Chapter 1 Introduction Bike Sharing System, different from traditional rentals, can process membership, rental and return back automatic. Now, over 10 years has passed since the generation of Bike Sharing system. According to “Report on the current situation of global and Chinese bike sharing market in 2020 and its future development trend”, there are 400 million registered users globally for Bike Sharing System, and the system has become a non-neglectable component in modern cities daily life. The report also figured out that the application scenarios of bike sharing tend to transition from commuting necessity to leisure, especially in some European countries such as Italy. In 2013, Hadi Fanaee-T and Joao Gama utilize the open access data of Capital Bikeshare System, which is still one of the most long-lived Bike Sharing system in the world, to predict sensing mobility in Washington D.C and therefore detect the important events in this city. Given the current situations provided above, it would be quite interesting to track whether this research still valid under different background, such as the transition trend of usage habit and especially with the disturbance of the major events, Covid-19. To conduct a comprehensive study, we collect the weather data and Capital Bikeshare’s data in Washington D.C from 2019 to 2020, and propose 3 major questions, which write as: Service Activation Transition Rate: does the Registered customer base of the Capital BikeShare increases during our monitored period (Casual-user to Registered-user)? Deciding-Factor Analysis: how does the factors of weather type (temperature, humidity, windspeed) and date (year, month, hour, weekday) affect the count of the bike-sharing rental? Events/Holiday Detection: can we detect important events and holiday trends in the city by looking at the bike-rental data? "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources Two data sources were introduced in this research, the first one was from the homepage of Capital Bikeshare, which includes the following variables (731 samples, each sample indicate a day’s record in Washington D.C. during 2019 and 2020): Duration (Duration of trip), Start Date (Includes start date and time), End Date (Includes end date and time), Bike Number (Includes ID number of bike used for the trip), Member Type (Indicates whether user was a “registered” member or a “casual” rider), Season (Season type obtained from Start Date and End Date), Day Type (Weekday or Weekend Day obtained from Start Date and End Date). This data has been processed by Capital Bikeshare to remove trips that were taken by staff as they serviced and inspected the system, trips that were taken to/from any of our “test” stations at our warehouses and any trips lasting less than 60 seconds (potentially false starts or users trying to redock a bike to ensure it was secure). The other data source was from freemeteo.com, which provides detailed weather forecasts, real time weather observations, historical data for all regions of our planet. Here we collect weather records of Washington D.C in 2019 and 2020 to incorporate with the data collected from Capital Bikeshare. In accordance with our research objective, we include the following variables (731 samples, each sample indicate a day): date, min_temp (daily minimum temperature), max_temp (daily maximum temperature), max_steady_wind (maximum steady wind of the day), total_daily_precipitation (total daily precipitation), description (description of weather types, such as “rain”, “snowfall”, “thunderstorm”etc.). "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation The Capital Bikeshare data was collected by Zhuoyue Hao via … The weather data was collected by Yeqi Zhang via web crawler implementation, where the weather website was first downloaded by httr and GET function, and the table data was then extracted from the website by html_table function from rvest package. The detail of this process was displayed in Session3, Data Transformation. Note that the original weather data collected from freemeteo.com had 10 variables, the other variables were “maximum wind gust”, “snow depth”, “pressure”, “icon (of weather type)”. We abandon those variables for they are harder to be sensed by human beings (such as “pressure”) or less relevant to the questions we are studying, such as “maximum wind gust” and “snow depth”. The former one just indicated the weather condition of a particular moment, not the overall weather circumstance for the whole day, and the later one was just available in some particular days during the winter, while in most days of the year, there is no snow and of course, no “snow depth”. Besides, a few days of weather data from 2019 to 2020 were missing, for example, there was no data for 2020-12-30; therefore, the authors filled in the data of those missing days and marked their values as NAs.
